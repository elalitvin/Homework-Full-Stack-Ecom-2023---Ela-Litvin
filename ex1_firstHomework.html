  <h3>Cigarettes After Sex</h3>
  <p>Cigarettes <b>After</b> Sex is an American dream pop band formed in El Paso, Texas, in 2008 by Greg Gonzalez. The band is known for their ethereal, limerent and often dream-like musical style, lyrics often based on the themes of romance and love, as well as Gonzalez's voice, which has been described as "androgynous".[7] While marketed as an ambient pop band, Cigarettes After Sex are also considered to be shoegaze, slowcore and indie rock. </p>
